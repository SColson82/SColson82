# SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT: You can view the results of my most impressive project on the [ATL-Foodie](https://atl-foodie-page.herokuapp.com) website.
### I worked as a part of a group for the Georgia Tech Data Analysis Bootcamp to complete this project. 
### We used Python/Flask & HTML/JS/CSS to build the web dashboard.
* The website is reliably deployed using Heroku.
* The database is housed using SQLite.

> ### [ATL-Foodie](https://atl-foodie-page.herokuapp.com) — Analysis of restaurant ratings in the Atlanta, GA area using the Yelp Academic Dataset. 
> * This was a 2 week group project for the Georgia Tech/Trilogy Data Analysis Bootcamp.
> * Used Python/Flask & HTML/JS/CSS to build the web dashboard. 
> * My part in this was deployment through the Heroku application; ETL of the dataset from Yelp zip file to SQLite database; collaborating on the Map and Ratings pages. 
> 
> ### [Car-ETL](https://github.com/SColson82/Car-ETL) — Postgres database of vehicle-for-sale listings web-scraped from Auto.com through API calls. 
> * Worked with a group of 3 others to over a 1 week period to create a Postgres database. 
> * Started with a customer dataset from Kaggle which included factors important in determining which vehicle a customer might be interested in (IE: family size, income, careertype).
> * Webscraped vehicle listings from [Autolist.com](https://www.autolist.com) and merged these with features listed through [US Fuel Economy](https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/download.shtml) to create a dataset that could be manipulated using Postgres to determine which customers should receive notifications for specific vehicles.
> * My part in this was collection of the vehicle Data; ETL on the dataset; deployment to the database. 
> 
> ### [Covid Vaccine Analysis](https://github.com/SColson82/Covid-Data-Analysis-Project) — Analyzed 30 days of vaccine and new case data to determine the current effects that vaccinations were having on new Covid case numbers.
> 
> * This project was completed as part of a group of 3 for the Georgia Tech/Trilogy Data Analysis Bootcamp.
> * Collected and visualized data pertaining to new Covid Cases and Vaccination counts using Matplotlib and Seaborn. 
> * My part in this project was collaboration in transforming the data and creating visualizations and creating the README.
