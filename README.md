# NOTE: You can view the results of my most impressive project on the [ATL-Foodie](https://atl-foodie-page.herokuapp.com) website.
### I worked as a part of a group for the Georgia Tech/Trilogy Data Analysis Bootcamp to complete this project. 
### We used Python/Flask & HTML/JS/CSS to build the web dashboard.
* The website is reliably deployed using Heroku.
* The database is housed using SQLite.

### Links to Additional Details in Project Titles

> ### [ATL-Foodie](https://atl-foodie-page.herokuapp.com) — Analysis of restaurant ratings in the Atlanta, GA area using the Yelp Academic Dataset. 
> * This was a 2 week group project for the Georgia Tech/Trilogy Data Analysis Bootcamp.
> * Used Python/Flask & HTML/JS/CSS to build the web dashboard. 
> * My part in this was deployment through the Heroku application; ETL of the dataset from Yelp zip file to SQLite database; collaborating on the Map and Ratings pages. 
> 
> ### [Car-ETL](https://github.com/SColson82/Car-ETL) — Postgres database of vehicle-for-sale listings webscraped from Auto.com through API calls. 
> * Worked with a group of 3 others to over a 1 week period to create a Postgres database. 
> * Started with a customer dataset from Kaggle which included factors important in determining which vehicle a customer might be interested in (IE: family size, income, careertype).
> * Webscraped vehicle listings from [Autolist.com](https://www.autolist.com) and merged these with features listed through [US Fuel Economy](https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/download.shtml) to create a dataset that could be manipulated using Postgres to determine which customers should receive notifications for specific vehicles.
> * My part in this was collection of the vehicle Data; ETL on the dataset; deployment to the database. 
> 
> ### [Covid Vaccine Analysis](https://github.com/SColson82/Covid-Data-Analysis-Project) — 
> 
> * Used Agile & Scrum methodologies to iteratively deploy Natural Language Processing (NLP) models
> * Practiced CI/CD via blue/green RESTful Flask microservices on AWS EB to facilitate JSON post requests
> * Launched and managed a PostgreSQL instance on AWS RDS to store millions of GoogleBooks data
> 
> ### [Flight Prices](https://ryan.zernach.com/portfolio/airline-price-predictor-how-are-flight-prices-calculated/) — Airline Pricing Analysis & Interactive Pricing User-Interface
> 
> * Built front-end user interface with Flask for user to interact w/ a predictive machine learning model
> * Tediously gathered 27M rows of data, wrangled/cleaned to 9M, uploaded data to Kaggle
> * As a data analyst, I generated statistical analyses, distribution charts, and business intelligence insights
> 
> ### [Brain Power](https://ryan.zernach.com/portfolio/brainpower-the-future-of-communicating-with-technology/) — Using Machine Learning & an EEG Device to Control Technology
> 
> * Built an application for the user to control light switches & thermostats with their brain
> * Collected data from an EEG device and used Scikit-Learn to train a predictive model
> * Deployed back-end Python get request API w/ Flask: communicate w/ EEG device, detect brain patterns
> 
> ### [Spotify Music](https://ryan.zernach.com/portfolio/spotify-song-suggester-which-songs-are-most-similar-to-your-favorites/) — Recommends New Music Based on Your Favorite Songs
> 
> * Connected with Spotify’s API to harvest data (and metadata) about the songs in their database
> * Built back-end Python API’s (get and post requests) to return predicted songs data to front-end

I am a Data Analyst with a passion to help others.

I am finishing the Trilogy/Georgia Tech bootcamp for Data Analysis in November 2021 with an A+ and have classroom-level experience in Python and SQL languages; SQL and NoSQL databases; ETL process; JavaScript interactive visualizations and dashboards; Tableau; and Machine Learning.

Currently, I am most proud of an Analysis of the Atlanta, GA area restaurant ratings using the Yelp Academic Dataset. To display this analysis, my team and I used Heroko application deployment. It can be viewed at https://atl-foodie-page.herokuapp.com.

My personal github is https://github.com/SColson82 in which you may view all of the projects that I have worked on since beginning this journey.

I love what I am learning and I am passionate about leaving the world a better place than it was when I came in to it. Using Data Science I look forward to making this passion my profession.
