# NOTE: You can view the results of my most impressive full-stack project on the [Landscape Supply App](https://landscapesupply.app) website.
### I wrote the iOS/Android app in React Native.
### I used Python/Flask & HTML/JS/CSS to build the web dashboard and back-end api's.
### I hosted the cloud infrastructure & authentication for this project on the Google Cloud Platform:
* The website is reliably deployed on Google App Engine.
* The database is securely housed in Google Firestore.
