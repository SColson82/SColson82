# NOTE: You can view the results of my most impressive project on the [ATL-Foodie](https://atl-foodie-page.herokuapp.com) website.
### I worked as a part of a group for the Georgia Tech/Trilogy Data Analysis Bootcamp to complete this project. 
### We used Python/Flask & HTML/JS/CSS to build the web dashboard.
* The website is reliably deployed using Heroku.
* The database is housed using SQLite.
