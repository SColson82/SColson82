# What I'm working on now: You can view my most recent project work at: [SDXLIB: A Python Library That Eases the User Experience for the AtlanticWave-SDX](https://github.com/SColson82/sdxlib).
### The AtlanticWave-SDX project is an intercontinental collaborative effort aimed at simplifying network exchange points between North and South America, and Africa, using software-defined networking (SDN). SDXLIB is a library designed to extend the functionality of this project by providing an abstracted, user-friendly interface, allowing users to interact with and manage network resources programmatically, such as through interactive Python notebooks.
